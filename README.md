# CARAI - Customer Assisted Repair Automation Intelligence

## Project Overview

CARAI is an innovative online platform designed to connect car owners with professional mechanics by leveraging AI and advanced software architecture. Car owners can easily publish their vehicle problems, receive AI-assisted diagnostic suggestions, and book appointments for in-person inspections by mechanics.

This platform streamlines the car repair process, making it easier and faster to diagnose issues and schedule repairs. The project is currently in active development and incorporates a **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** architecture to enhance scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Key Features

- **Publish Car Problems:** Users can describe their vehicle issues in detail, helping mechanics understand the problem remotely.
- **AI-Powered Solutions:** AI algorithms analyze submitted problems and provide preliminary diagnostic suggestions to assist mechanics and users.
- **Appointment Booking:** Users can book specific dates and times for mechanics to inspect their vehicles.
- **CQRS Architecture:** The system is designed using CQRS principles, separating commands (updates) from queries (reads) to improve performance and scalability.
- **Mechanic Interface:** Mechanics have access to submitted issues and AI diagnostics to prepare for efficient inspections.
- **Active Development:** The project is still evolving, with continuous improvements and features being added.

## Architecture

The project is built on a **CQRS architecture**, which divides the system into two distinct parts:

- **Command Side:** Handles operations that change state (e.g., publishing a problem, booking an appointment).
- **Query Side:** Handles data retrieval and queries (e.g., viewing car problems, mechanic schedules).

This separation allows for optimized performance, scalability, and easier maintenance.
